    "### What is Dask? \n",
    "\n",
    "Dask is a flexible library for parallel computing in Python, that follows the syntax of the PyData ecosystem. If you are familiar with Numpy, pandas and scikit-learn then think of Dask as their faster cousin. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd                   import dask.dataframe as dd\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('2015-01-01.csv')    df = dd.read_csv('2015-*-*.csv')\n",
    "df.groupby(df.user_id).value.mean()   df.groupby(df.user_id).value.mean().compute()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " Since they are all family, Dask allows you to scale your existing workflows with a small amount of changes. Dask enables you to accelerate computations and perform those that don't fit in memory. It works in your laptop but it also scales out to large clusters while providing a dashboard with great diagnostic tools. "

    "## When to use Dask?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before trying to use Dask, there are some questions to determine if Dask might be suitable for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Does your data fit in memory? \n",
    "    - Yes: Use pandas or numpy.  \n",
    "    - No : Dask might be able to help. \n",
    "- Do your computations take for ever?\n",
    "    - Yes: Dask might be able to help. \n",
    "    - No : Awesome.\n",
    "- Do you have embarrassingly parallelizable code?\n",
    "    - Yes: Dask might be able to help.\n",
    "    - No?: If you are not sure here are some [examples](https://examples.dask.org/applications/embarrassingly-parallel.html) \n",
    "    - No: I'm sorry, although Dask might have some hope for you.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "**Bottom Left:** You don't need Dask.    \n",
    "**Elsewhere:** Dask fair game.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dask/dask-ml/main/docs/source/images/dimensions_of_scale.svg\"\n",
    "     width=\"65%\"\n",
    "     alt=\"Dask zones\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When we say \"Dask might be able to help\" it is because you should try first to accelerate your code with Numpy and or Numba, checking types used on your Dataframes, and then maybe consider Dask. Now even when using Dask, we can't guarantee that things will be faster, it depends on what is the code behind.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Even when you have large datasets, at some point you want to double check if you have reduced things to a manageable level where going back to pandas or Numpy might be the best call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best practices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning curve to use Dask can be a bit intimidating, that's why we want to point you out to some best practices links that will make the process smoother. We will go over some of these topics but we want to leave here these links for future reference\n",

    "- Dealing with DataFrames? Check this [DataFrames best practices](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/dataframe-best-practices.html)\n",
